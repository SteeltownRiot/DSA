    "The tuples remained the same in the Keep_Employees table and there are only 5 in the Pay table. This has a couple of different implications. While creating another table adds a modicum of storage need, we potentially make up for it by eliminating repeating the same 5 hourly wages. This my not be a wash even with only 20 records, but for a company like Cerner thousands of employees it would make a large difference. When we are talking about sales records that can number in the tens of millions it is neccessary. The other implication is now if we want to change the hourly wage for a rating, we do it to one field in one record and it becomes true for all employees of that rating. We could, of course, write an update that changes every records with a rating n to hourly wage x and that would probably not be noticeably expensive over 20 tuples. Again, with a large corporation or sales data this kind of operation would be too expensive."
