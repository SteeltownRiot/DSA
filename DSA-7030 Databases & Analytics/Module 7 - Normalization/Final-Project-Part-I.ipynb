Ideally, there would be an IUCR table containing all IUCR codes with all associated NIBRS codes. I cannot map a NIBRS code to all of the IUCR codes I downloaded because the FBI Codes in the data set seem to be nonsense and this data set does not contain every offense so I cannot derive all of the nonsensical NIBRS codes used. The NIBRs codes were last updated in 2011, as far as I can tell. Yet the list the FBI makes available does not come close to matching what is in this data.\n",

Finally, I used the XLOOKUP() function to match each row's relevant data (block, location description, lat_long) with the data in the relevant tab (block, location, geoloc) to grab the corresponding *_id field. I also used the XLOOKUP() function to match IUCR codes to NIBR codes. I then compared some of the decomposed table data to the original to make sure it was reconstituted correctly."
