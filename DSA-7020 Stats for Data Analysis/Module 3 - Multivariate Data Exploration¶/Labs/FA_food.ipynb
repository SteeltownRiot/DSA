    "# Factor Analysis on Food Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will do a factor analysis (FA) on food texture data set. The variables represent the texture measurements of pastry-type foods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set consists of 50 rows (observations) and 5 columns (features/variables). The features are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Oil: percentage oil in the pastry\n",
    " - Density: the productâ€™s density (the higher the number, the more dense the product)\n",
    " - Crispy: a crispiness measurement, on a scale from 7 to 15, with 15 being more crispy.\n",
    " - Fracture: the angle, in degrees, through which the pasty can be slowly bent before it fractures (the higher the number, the more it can bend). \n",
    " - Hardness: a sharp point is used to measure the amount of force required before breakage occurs."

To the extent that the variables have an underlying communality, fewer factors capture most of the variance in the data set. This allows us to aggregate a large number of observable variables in a model to represent an underlying concept, making it easier to understand the data."
