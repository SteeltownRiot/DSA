    "\n",
    "In many events there are no definite outcomes, so the outcome can't be predicted with total certainty.\n",
    "What we can say is how likely the outcomes are to happen, using the idea of probability. \n",
    "Inferential statistics is built on the foundation of probability theory and has been remarkably successful in guiding opinion about the conclusions to be drawn from data. \n",
    "\n",
    "One conception of probability is drawn from the idea of symmetrical outcomes. \n",
    "For example, the two possible outcomes of tossing a fair coin seem not to be distinguishable in any way that affects which side will land up or down. \n",
    "Therefore the probability of heads is taken to be 1/2, as is the probability of tails. \n",
    "In general, if there are N symmetrical outcomes, the probability of any given one of them occurring is taken to be 1/N. \n",
    "Thus, if a six-sided die is rolled, the probability of any one of the six sides coming up is 1/6.\n"

    "For a coin-toss experiment, $S$ would be the outcomes of “Head” and “Tail”, which we may represent by $S = \\{H, T\\}$. Formally, the performance of a random experiment is the unpredictable selection of an outcome in $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R package `prob` has all the functions to find probability of different basic events. \n",
    "A sample space is (usually) represented by a data frame.\n",

    "There are three axioms that establish the foundation of Probability theory. Axioms are assumptions that are accepted as true  statements without proof and serve as building blocks. For example `if a=b then b=a` is an algebraic axiom. \n",

    "**Axioms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering $S$ an event set with a probability measure $P$ so that the probability of any event $A$ in $S$ is given by $P(A)$, the probability measure obeys the following axioms: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. $P(A)\\ge0$ : Probability measure cannot be negative. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",

    " 2. $P(S)=1$    : Sum of all probabilities in $S$ is 1. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 3. if $\\{A_1, A_2, ..., A_j\\}$ is a sequence of mutually exclusive events so that their intersection $A_i\\cap A_j$ is empty set for all distinct pairs of $i$ and $j$, then the probability of their unions $P(A_1\\cup A_2\\cup \\dots A_j\\cup \\dots)$ can be computed as the sum of their probabilities $P(A_1)+P(A_2)+\\dots P(A_j)+\\dots$.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Every other property or theorem can be proved by using these axioms. For example, the following theorem can be proved: \n",
    " \n",
    "*The probability that either A or B will happen or that both will happen \n",
    "is the probability of A happening plus the probability of B happening \n",
    "less the probability of the joint occurrence of A and B.*\n",
