    "**[Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)** are a popular way to visualize the tradeoffs between sensitivitiy and specificity in a binary classifier. It is a plot of true positive rate (specificity) vs. false positive rate (1-sensitivity). \n",
    "Computing the area under this curve is one way to summarize the performance of the classifier in a single value; this metric is so common that if data scientists say \"area under the curve\" or \"AUC\", you can assume that an ROC curve is meant. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the most straightforward and intuitive metric for classifier performance is accuracy as computed above. Unfortunately, there are circumstances where simple accuracy does not work well. For example, with a disease that only affects 1 in a million people, a completely bogus screening test that always reports \"negative\" would be 99.9999% accurate. **Unlike accuracy, ROC curves are insensitive to class imbalance; the bogus screening test would have an AUC of 0.5**, which is like not having a test at all.\n",
