    "Tool Box is a tech website that listed some project ideas. Disinformation has plagued the internet since the days of message boards long before the World Wide Web made the Internet widely accessible. But those were always on the fringe of even the eccentric computer community. YouTube really kicked the door open to conspiracy theories, starting with bringing \"Flat Earth\" nearly into the mainstream, with even superstar athletes publicly promoting it. Social media has supercharged the spread of disinformation in the last half a decade, and I spent way too much of my time from 2015 through 2017, when I mostly gave up social media, on Facebook correcting friends and family posting all kinds of crazy conspiracy theories and flat out fake news. All the while, these same people were denouncing news they disagreed with as fake news. Finding a data set that will allow me to try and predict fake news from real news made me want to jump in and give it a try.\n",

Unfortunately, I think too many people would assume nefarious intent if my model says a news source they feel like they can trust is mostly fake or a story they believe to be fake is actually true. So realisticly, the audience would be folks like I used to be (and sometimes still cannot help myself) looking to verify or refute a news story so they can try to inform their friends and family to its veracity. The value they would get from this project would be to spend less time researching the truth of a news story so they can spend more time on homework or with their familys."
