    "Graph theory is the study of **graphs** that are mathematical structures to model relations between objects or entities. The **networks and trees** we will use for visualization are mathematically represented as graphs. So we will look at some basic graph theory concepts. \n",

    "1. **Degree Centrality** : The number of connections (edges) between a node and other nodes. The higher the degree centrality, the more important, or central, a node is in a network. There are two kinds: In degree and out degree. In degree centrality is often a proxy for popularity. If people are frequently interacting with you, then you are likely \"popular\". The reasons for your popularity depend on the type of network (e.g. a famous actor is likely popular because he is interesting). Out degree centrality can be thought of as an indicator of gregariousness. If you message a lot of people, you might be considered outgoing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Betweenness Centrality** : High betewenness centrality is indicated by a person being a broker between two networks. These people are often called \"connectors\". For example, if somebody has a strong network in the defense contractor industry, and a strong set of network connections inside the Pentagon, their betweenness centrality between those two networks will be measured as high compared to a person without strong connections in both networks. In this way, it can be illustrated for example how high betweenness nodes are important for health social networks. \n",
