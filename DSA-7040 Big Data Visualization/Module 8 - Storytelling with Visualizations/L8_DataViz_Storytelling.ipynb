    "\n",
    "In the beginning, we started with the **types and the impact** of the visualization. We have seen that we can use visualization in conjunction with data science in two major ways: **exploratory** vs. **explanatory** visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is **not just about showing data, it's about giving a message**, making a point, convincing an audience by using the data; so there is a **story** to be told with data visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A whole bunch of charts/plots that look like randomly placed do not tell a story.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**We need to use design elements such as captions, text annotations, layout**, etc. to help tell the story better. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to provide a **context** and **explain** what the visualization shows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data storytelling is a **structured approach for communicating data insights**, and it involves a combination of three key elements: \n",
    "\n",
    " - data, \n",
    " \n",
    " - visuals, \n",
    " \n",
    " - and narrative. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When **narrative is coupled** with data, it helps to explain to the audience what’s happening in the data and **why a particular insight is important**. \n",
    " \n",
    "When **visuals are applied** to data, they can enlighten the audience to insights that they wouldn’t see without charts or graphs. **When narrative and visuals are merged together, they can engage the audience.**\n",
