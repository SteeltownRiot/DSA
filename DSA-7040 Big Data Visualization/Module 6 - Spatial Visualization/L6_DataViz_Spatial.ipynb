    "\n",
    "Data sets that have geographic components are called **geospatial** data. These components can be directly geographical coordinates, or they can be associated with geographic locations through addresess, zip codes, FIPS codes, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Types of geospatial data include a large variety such as \n",
    " - census data, \n",
    " - remote sensing data (satellite images), \n",
    " - GPS tracking data, \n",
    " - topography data, \n",
    " - LIDAR based digital elevation models, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial data sets are usually stored, visualized, and explored through the use of **geographic information systems (GIS)**. These systems integrate data from  a variety of sources and **overlay several layers of information on maps.** \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of **Google Maps** as a simpler form of GIS with only street and traffic data. \n",
    "\n",
    "GIS represent geospatial data as **vectors and related attributes**. Streets are an example of this: they are represented as **lines defined in a coordinate system** and the related attributes such as street names, zip codes, etc. "

    "A **coordinate system**  uses coordinates to uniquely determine the **position of a point in a space.**\n",

    "\n",
    "A **geodetic datum** or geodetic system is a coordinate system, and a set of reference points, used to locate places on the Earth. \n",

    "\n",
    "Datums are used in geodesy, navigation, surveying, and satellite navigation systems to translate positions indicated on maps to their real position on Earth. Each starts with an ellipsoid, and then defines latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinates. One or more locations on the Earth's surface is chosen as an anchor \"base-point\". For example, **WGS84** is an approximate definition of sea level as an ellipsoid; a more accurate definition is Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (**EGM2008**). Because the Earth is an imperfect ellipsoid, localised datums can give a more accurate representation of the area of coverage than WGS84.\n",

NAD83 may be considered a local referencing system. In geodetic coordinates, the Earth's surface is approximated by an ellipsoid and locations near the surface are described in terms of latitude, longitude, and height.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **map projection** is transformation of the **latitudes and longitudes** of locations on the surface of a sphere or an ellipsoid into locations **on a plane**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Map projections are necessary for creating maps.** \n",
    "\n",
    "All map projections **distort** the surface in some fashion. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distortions are acceptable and others are not. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Different map projections exist in order to preserve some properties of the sphere-like body at the expense of other properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "A map projection chooses a model for the shape of the Earth and transforms its coordinates to planar coordinates of the chosen projection surface. Projection surface should be able to be unfolded into a plane without stretching or tearing; these suraces are called *developable*. The cylinder, cone, and the plane are all developable surfaces. **The sphere and ellipsoid do not have developable surfaces, so any projection of them onto a plane will have to distort the image.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Projections can be classified by the preservation of a property:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conformal**: Conformal, or orthomorphic, map projections **preserve angles locally** (e.g. Mercator projection).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equidistant**: These projections **preserve distance** from some standard point or line (e.g. Eqiorectangular preserves distances along meridians). \n",

    "**We make a distinction between *vector* maps and *raster* maps.** \n",

    "**Vector maps** represent geospatial data as a collection of points, lines, and polygons. A vector map of US contains detailed polygons to define national, state, and county borders, lakes, and other closed contour informaion, and curves approximated by lines to represent rivers, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vector maps can be redrawn at different zoom levels **without loss of information if they have detailed enough polygonal representation** of the shapes. **Shapefiles** are one of the file formats that store geographic vector maps and related attributes. A shapefile format consists of minimum three files: **.shp** file that contains geometry data, **.shx** file that contains positional indices of the geometry data, and **.dbf** file that contains rows and columns of attribute data in dBase IV format. **Shapefiles for U.S. regions can be found at [US Census Bureau web site](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html).**"
