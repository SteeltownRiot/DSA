    "RSS is a type of web feed which allows users to access updates to online content in a **standardized, computer-readable format**. \n",
    "These feeds can, for example, allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator. \n",
    "The news aggregator will automatically check the RSS feed for new content, allowing the content to be automatically passed from website to website or from website to user. \n",
    "This passing of content is called web syndication. \n",
    "Websites usually use RSS feeds to publish frequently updated information, such as blog entries, news headlines, audio, video. An RSS document (called \"feed\", \"web feed\", or \"channel\") includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author's name.\n",
