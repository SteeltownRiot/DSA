    "Before we begin doing some of the more complicated aspects of data science, it is important to get our feet wet with manipulating data. Now, it is impossible to cover all aspects of data manipulation because the scenarios are endless. It is the job of the data scientist to figure out the most creative and effective means by which to manipulate data. The purpose of this module is to get you comfortable with the tools and provide you with the grammar of data manipulation so that you can begin to string together your own data pipeline to meet your data science needs.\n",

In this case, it opens the file `NationalNames1.csv` and then reads it. Since this is read in a single string, we need to `split()` the string on the `\\n` character that we discussed above. This puts it in a format of different strings, or what may look like rows of data. However, we'll want to access different values within the rows, so in order to do that we need to split the rows by their delimiter. In this case, commas separate values, which is appropriate given the original file extension name `.csv`, which stands for \"comma separat*ed* values\". What this returns is a list of lists, which, believe it or not, makes the data easier to manipulate.\n",

    "That was a very simple line of code, which is one of the benefits of using `pandas`. We can break it down step by step. Let's start with the line `df['Name']=='James'`. This is going to return `True` or `False` given whether or not the condition is met. Running this line by itself would just return a boolean for each index.  For this reason, we wrap that in `df[...]`, which returns the subset of the dataframe, `df` where the index returns `True`, thus returning all rows that match the string, \"James\".  Once again, the final `.head()` piece is a `pandas` method that you can call on dataframes to return the first rows. You could pass a numerical argument to return the first X-number of rows. For example, if we put `df[df['Name']=='James'].head(10)`, the first 10 rows of this subset would be returned."
