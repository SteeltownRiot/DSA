    "In these notebooks, we will ask you to write and execute your own code for questions that will look similar to what we have learned in the Labs and Practices. However, Exercises will often be a bit more challenging in that 1) you may be working with a new data set with which you will have to familiarize yourself, and 2) you will be asked to write code to problems you have yet to see.\n"
