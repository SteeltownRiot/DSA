    "Markdown is a convenient way to format text and Jupyter comes with a nice extension to change your cells from being \"code\" cells to \"markdown\" cells. This comes in handy when you are trying to explain aspects of your code and you don't want to rely purely on code comments. It also tidies things up and makes your text more readable by including things features like headers or text emphasis (italics or bolding).\n",

    "The cells in Jupyter are defaulted to being code cells. However, you can simply change the the cell type in the top bar by changing the drop down box from \"Code\" to \"Markdown\" (*See the gif below for guidance*). Once the cell has been shifted to Markdown, you can then run the cell and it will render in a more reader friendly format.  "
