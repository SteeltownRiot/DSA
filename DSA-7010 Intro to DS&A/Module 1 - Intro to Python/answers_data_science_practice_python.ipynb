    "This is your first practice notebooks. The purpose of these practices is to reiterate some of the content that you went over in the lab, as well as introduce some new material to you with a bit of a guiding helping along the way. Unlike the labs, these notebooks will be incomplete in the sense that you will actively be editing/writing code to modify/produce output. The skeleton is already here but throughout these practice notebooks, we will be asking you to add the rest of the corpus. In doing so, you will hone your data science techniques as well as learn how to search for solutions to your programming hurdles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will be going over the fundamentals of data science with Python. Much of the content will be similar to your lab, [Introduction to Data Science with Python](../labs/intro_data_science_python.ipynb), and thus it will serve as a good guide post to answering some of the questions. We'll begin today with reading in the data..."
