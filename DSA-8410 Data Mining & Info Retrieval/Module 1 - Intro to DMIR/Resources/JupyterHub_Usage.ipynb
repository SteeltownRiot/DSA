    "## Closing and Halting Notebooks\n",
    "Notebooks and code cells access the underlying computing resources of the servers hosting them. Hence, properly closing and halting notebooks is a good way to avoid slowing down the system and prevent crashes that could make you lose your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to properly close and halt a notebook, you can click on `File > Close and Halt`, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![screen](../images/JH_Closing.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "Running large tasks or loading large datasets can sometimes take time, keeping your Python (or R) kernel busy. The circle in the upper corner (kernel indicator), will show whether the kernel is idle or busy like in this screenshot:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At times you might run into a kernel that stays busy for longer than necessary (again, this depends on the task), which could be a sign of a problem in your code. If you get stuck with a busy kernel, you can interrupt it without shutting down your notebook by selecting `Kernel > Interrupt` or by pressing `'I'` twice (see keyboard shortcuts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since crashes or busy kernels can happen when dealing with large data, it is important to keep your work up-to-date by constantly saving your notebooks. Selecting `File > Save and Checkpoint` will save your most recent work and create a checkpoint that you can revert to if needed. You can go back to a previously saved checkpoint by selecting it from `File > Revert to Checkpoint`. Just like in the example below, your checkpoints will be listed with the date and time of your last update.\n",
