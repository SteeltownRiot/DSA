    "All computations in cloud applications are distributed to servers in a data center. \n",

    "Private clouds can also support a hybrid cloud model by supplementing local infrastructure with computing capacity from an external public cloud.\n",
    "For example, the Research Compute Cloud (RC2) is a private cloud, built by IBM, \n",
    "that interconnects the computing and IT resources at eight IBM Research Centers scattered throughout the United States,\n",
    "Europe, and Asia. \n",
    "A hybrid cloud provides access to clients, the partner network, and third parties. \n",
    "In summary, public clouds promote standardization, preserve capital investment, and offer application flexibility. \n",
    "Private clouds attempt to achieve customization and offer higher efficiency, resiliency, security, and privacy.\n",
    "Hybrid clouds operate in the middle, with many compromises in terms of resource sharing."
