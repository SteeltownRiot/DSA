    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is IAM?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service. It helps you \n",
    "securely control access to AWS resources for other users in same account.\n",
    "Using IAM its possible to control both authentication and authorization. \n",
    "You can control who can access AWS resources (way of authentication) and \n",
    "what resources other users can use and in what different ways\n",
    "(way of authorization).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### How To get the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user\n",
    "\n",
    "Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key. Thses are \n",
    "used to sign the programmatic requests that we make to AWS. Access keys\n",
    "can be created from the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI or through an SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "IAM access keys should be used instead of AWS account root user access keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only time that you can view or download the secret access keys is when \n",
    "you create the keys either through AWS console(website), CLI(command line) \n",
    "or SDK(for example python). You cannot recover them later. However, you can\n",
    "always create new access keys at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Click here](https://youtu.be/Ul6FW4UANGc) to watch a short video on IAM \n",

    "### What does IAM offer?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shared access to your AWS account\n",
    "Give and manage permissions to other people to use resources in your AWS \n",
    "account. You dont have to share your password or access key to give access \n",
    "to your resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Granular permissions\n",
    "Its possible to give different levels of permissions to different people \n",
    "for different resources. For example, you might allow some users complete \n",
    "access to Amazon EC2, Amazon S3 and other AWS services. For other users, \n",
    "you might allow read-only access to just some S3 buckets, or permission \n",
    "to administer just some EC2 instances but nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can securely give applications that run on EC2 instances the credentials \n",
    "that they need in order to access other AWS resources, like S3 buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multi-factor authentication (MFA)\n",
    "You can add two-factor authentication to your account and to individual users \n",
    "for extra security. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Identity federation\n",
    "You can allow authenticated users elsewhere, for example in your corporate network \n",
    "to get temporary access to your AWS account.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Identity information for assurance\n",
    "If you use AWS CloudTrail, you receive log records that include information about \n",
    "those who made requests for resources in your account. This information is based \n",
    "on IAM identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. PCI DSS Compliance\n",
    "IAM supports the processing, storage, and transmission of credit card data by a \n",
    "merchant or service provider, and has been validated as being compliant with \n",
    "Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Eventually Consistent\n",
    "IAM, like many other AWS services, is eventually consistent. IAM achieves high \n",
    "availability by replicating data across multiple servers within Amazon's data \n",
    "centers around the world. If a request to change some data is successful, the \n",
    "change is committed and safely stored. Such changes include creating or \n",
    "updating users, groups, roles, or policies. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. Free to use\n",
    "AWS Identity and Access Management is a feature of your AWS account offered at \n",
    "no additional charge. "
